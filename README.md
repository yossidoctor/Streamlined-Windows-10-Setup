# Streamlined Windows Setup

This project was born out of a desire to optimize and improve the performance of Windows, providing a better overall experience. It aims to achieve an optimized Windows installation without extensive configurations.

The journey began a few years ago when I delved into the intricacies of Windows settings, driven by the curiosity to understand how the operating system functions under the hood.

My initial goal was to optimize and improve its performance for everyday use while utilizing the hardware available (an Intel NUC at the time), but my curiosity led me down a path of exploring anything from Group Policy objects, Windows Registry and hardening/debloating scripts, to STIGs (Security Technical Implementation Guides) and custom/stripped Windows ISOs like Windows-Ameliorated & Atlas-OS.
